# In main, there are two local variables named x and lx. At line 14, both of these local variables are passed to the modify_args function. After the call to modify_args finished, which of main's two local variables did the modify_args function change?
    # x
    # lx (THIS IS THE ANSWER)
    # both of them
    # neither of them

# Why is the modify_args function NOT able to change main's local variable x?
    # Because x is a number and therefore passed to a function by value (THIS IS THE ANSWER)
    # Because x is a list and therefore passed to a function by reference

# Why is the modify_args function able to change main's local variable lx?
